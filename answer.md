About this solution.

The solution I proposed does not fully correspond with the specification.
Moreover, it does not pass unit tests.
The fact is that I have no opportunity to run it on Unix based machine
(only Windows), so I designed the solution without bash. Anyway, it should
be runnable on Linux and Mac too.

About projects I took part.

1. Image processing system for International
 Dunhuang Project. I  used a neural net to distinguish 
 manuscripts from a background on photos.

2. Practice in Psychoacoustics project.
 MatLab developed educational software for 
 Saint Petersburg State University.
